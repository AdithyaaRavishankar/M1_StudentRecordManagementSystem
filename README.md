# Challenges Faced And How Was It Overcome:
 #### 1.During cpp-check, online resources helped a lot.
 #### 2.As most of the functions used contains othes function calls in them and required user input         so unit test couldnt properly done in most of the functions.
 #### 3.over all stack overflow helped a lot in resolving issues during this project.
