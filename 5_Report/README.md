 # Challenges Faced And How Was It Overcome:
  #### 1.During cpp-check, online resources helped a lot.
  #### 2.As most of the functions used contains othes function calls in them and required user input         so unit test couldnt properly done in most of the functions.


  #### 3.Stack overflow helped a lot in resolving issues during this project.
  
 

# Introduction
* The Student Record Management System is based on the concept of managing student's record.
* This is created to keep store of the information of the student.
* It can be used in Educational institutes, like Schools,Colleges,Universities.
* This mini project contains limited features, but the essential one.
* This project is helpful for managing student information by adding,updating,removing,viewing and even searching the details of the students.

# Research
 ## C PROGRAMMING
 * This is a simple project which simply provide easy contents on c programming to the user after taking input from the user.
 * This project is built using traditional file handling system rather than Data base system. here the user provides his/her desired choice and the code after taking input from the user it runs the respective user defined funtion which prints the contents of the respective topic.

## Defining the System
* System bascically takes input from the user and checks for the file, and then it prints the file. for ruunig the code it checks for the available code and run it in the compiler (i.e) GCC and prints the output.
* For the suggestion part it takes suggestion from user and stores it in a file.
* The below image represents the above said informations.

# The 4W's and a H 
## WHAT
  * It is a simple Students Records Management System for managing students information.
## WHY
  * The main objective of this project is that the students data that are stored can be easily edited ,removed and even updated by the user.
## WHO
  * People who are in need of managing student datas and information,mainly the institutions require this Student Records Management System and they are the end users of this project.
## WHERE
  * This project mainly comes in use in places like schools, colleges, instututes,and even in universities.
## HOW
  * This project is implemented using "c program" and uses traditional file systems and not database system.
